				<h1>Volleyball</h1>
				<p>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams of six people on a playing field divided into two by a net, based on the principle of hitting the volleyball ball with hands and arms, sending it over the net to the opposing side's playing field and making it touch the ground.In the photo here,the woman is an outside hitter and she is spiking.The game is played on a field separated by a net at the center line. During the game, each team's players are in their own half of the field and never cross the opponent's area.The aim of the game is to send the volleyball ball to the opponent's court by making a maximum of three passes, causing it to hit the ground and preventing the opposing team from achieving the same goal. The ball can be touched with the whole body, not just the hands and arms. Players cannot hold the ball steadily and cannot hit the ball twice in a row.</p>
